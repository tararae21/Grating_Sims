'INV' : Inverted mask, used when generating DFX file
'LG_lp' : Laguerre-Gauss topologocial charge and radial mode
'W#' : LG beam waist at interference plane as multiplied by wavelength
'ZP600' : zero-padded with 600 pixels on each side
'LG' : Hologram generated with LaguerrrGen MATLAB Function (found on FileExchange)
'LL' : Hologram generated with LaguerreL from MATLAB symbolic math toolbox 
NOTE: There's no differrence between the holograms generated by the different 
      functions, although all the ones that have currently been fabricated
      were the LG versions. Using the LG function is preferable; it is 
      CONSIDERABLY faster.
